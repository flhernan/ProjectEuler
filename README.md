# ProjectEuler

<p>
These are my original solutions to Project Euler problems, written in Python.
</p>

<p>
I've really honed my algorithmic thinking doing these problems, and my
solutions feature remarkable approaches to a variety of problems including
dynamic programming.
<p>

<p>
My favorite solutions are:
<p>
1. [54 - Poker hands](/p54.py)
</br>
2. [59 - XOR Decryption](/p59.py)
</br>
3. [58 - Spiral primes](/p58.py)
