# ProjectEuler
Project Euler problems encourage solving problems by
programming in efficient code. The most enjoyable
part of solving Project Euler is the satisfaction 
after finding a successful solution and modifying 
code to get a faster result. It turns me on. Sexually.
If you hire me, I will give you the best code you've
ever seen. But the keyboard will also be covered in jizz.
Buyer beware.
