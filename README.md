# ProjectEuler
Project Euler problems encourage solving problems by 
programming in efficient code. The most enjoyable
part of solving Project Euler is the satisfaction 
after finding a successful solution and modifying 
code to get a faster result. 

It is often said that The best solution is the 
easiest, but when it comes to programming, the 
the fastest solution is most prefered. Solutions
which are made by brute force give bad result
when the solution can be recieved faster. If you
hire me, not only will I give you fast and
efficient code, but I will give you the best code
you have ever seen. However, the keyboard will be
covered in jizz, because I get turned on sexually
once I have successful code. Buyers beware.
