# ProjectEuler

<p>
These are my original solutions to Project Euler problems, writtenin Python.
</p>

<p>
I've really honed my algorithmic thinking doing these problems,  and my
solutions feature remarkable approaches to a variety of problems including
dynamic programming [FILL IN MORE].
<p>

<p>
My favorite solutions are :
<p>
1. [54 - Poker hands](/p54.py)
</br>
3. [59 - XOR Decryption](/EulerAnswers/p59.hs)
</br>
4. [58 - Spiral primes](/EulerAnswers/p58.hs)
